|	  USAGE INSTRUCTIONS                    |
|                                               |
|  Compile all .cpp files into an executable    |
|  and run it without any arguments.            |
|                                               |
|  The program will prompt the user if they     |
|  would like to run the simulation using the   |
|  default values or their own. Inputting 'n'   |
|  will result in a series of prompts for the   |
|  user to enter custom values. Inputting 'y'   |
|  results in the simulation running with the   |
|  num_processes=12, num_bursts=6,num_cpu=4,    |
|  and t_slice=80.                              |

|        		OUTPUT			   |
|						   |
|  Stats for maximum, minimum, and average wait	   |
|  and turnaround times, average CPU utilization,  |
|  and average CPU utilization per process will be |
|  displayed for each scheduling algorithm in the  |
|  terminal. The event output for each scheduling  |
|  algorithm will be logged in a text file named   |
|  after the corresponding scheduling algorithm.   |
